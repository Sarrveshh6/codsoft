            <h1>Landing Page</h1>
            <p>Welcome to My First Landing Page!

                <br> Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by
                <br> This is my very first landing page, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with you. Iâ€™m currently learning web development, and this page is just one of the many cool things Iâ€™m building along the way.
                <br>
                Why I Made This
                Iâ€™m exploring the world of web development, learning how to create websites from scratch. <br>This landing page is a fun little project to showcase some of the skills Iâ€™m picking up on my journey.
                
                <br>
                <h2> Youâ€™ll Find Here:</h2>
                A simple, clean design (Iâ€™m still working on adding some fancy stuff! ðŸ˜…)
                A friendly vibe because who says websites have to be boring, right?
                A glimpse of what Iâ€™m learningâ€”expect things to get more exciting as I improve!
                My Learning Journey
                I'm currently doing a virtual internship in Web Development with Codsoft. Over the next few weeks, Iâ€™ll be adding more features and making this page even cooler. Stay tuned!
                
                Whatâ€™s Next?
                Iâ€™ll be experimenting with more interactive features, better layouts, and maybe even some animations. So, come back soon to see the improvements!
